    "text": "  <font color='blue'>We c ##ir ##cum ##vent this problem by anal ##ys ##ing data from Google T ##ren ##ds between January 1 s ##t 2019 and April 10 th 2020 in countries that had introduced a full lock ##down by the end of this period</font>  . This produces data on nine Western European countries . <font color='blue'>We also run a comparable analysis at the State level in the US ( see Figure S ##1 and Table S ##1 for the dates of lock ##down )</font> . As in previous work using Google T ##ren ##ds to successfully predict disease outbreak ##s ( 6 ) , tourism flows ( 7 ) and trading behaviour in financial markets ( 8 ) , we assume that search indicators provide accurate and representative information about the Google Search users ' current behaviour ##s and feelings . Furthermore , Google search data shows aggregate measures of search activity in a location ( e . g . a State or Country ) , and is thus less vulnerable to small - sample bias ( 9 ) . As set out in our pre - analysis plan ( OS ##F ; https : / / o ##s ##f . i ##o / 4 ##y ##w ##j ##c / ) , we submitted the thirteen following well - being related topic search terms to Google T ##ren ##ds : Bo ##redo ##m , Content ##ment , Di ##vor ##ce , I ##mp ##air ##ment , I ##rri ##ta ##bility , Lone ##liness , Panic , Sad ##ness , Sleep , St ##ress , Suicide , Well - being and W ##or ##ry . We have daily data on searches for all of these . <font color='blue'>This allows us to estimate not only the effect of lock ##down on well - being , but also to see whether the intensity of searches changes with the duration of lock ##down .</font>   <font color='blue'>To gauge the size of the lock ##down effects , Figure 2 reports the Di ##fference - in - Di ##fference ( Di ##D ) estimates ( Table S ##2 ) . 01 )</font>  . <font color='blue'>This could reflect the date at which lock ##down was implemented</font> . When we split Europe into early and late lock ##down ##s ( this latter group is composed of Ireland , Portugal and the UK ) ,  <font color='blue'>Is there evidence of adaptation to lock ##down ? The event study depicted in Figure 3 shows that searches for bored ##om continued to be higher throughout the lock ##down period .</font>   <font color='blue'>Lone ##liness increased briefly at lock ##down announcement before dropping back towards zero in both samples</font>  . <font color='blue'>There was also a gradual increase in sadness after the lock ##down</font> . The event studies for all of our variables appear in Figure S ##4 , and the estimated coefficients appear in Table S ##4 ."
