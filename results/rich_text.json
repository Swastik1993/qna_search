The spread of infectious viral diseases occur over a connected social network. Specifically, the goal was to understand the effect of network topology and lockdown strategies on disease spreading dynamics. To explore the effect of topology we assumed the social network over which the disease spreads to have small-world or scalefree properties characterized by a rewiring probability and degree distribution respectively. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified the spreading dynamics of infection over a given graph structure through changes in properties of agent interaction. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Thereafter, lockdown efficacy was evaluated as a function of lockdown start times and duration. Thus, we propose that ABM approach can be used to assess various lockdown strategies that aim to prevent breakdown of medical infrastructure while accounting for realistic social network configurations specific to a local population. \\n\\nAbbreviations ABM: Agent Based Modelling \\n\\n\"},{\"Lucene ID\":\"s2ls7xeu\",\"BERT-SQuAD Answer with Highlights\":\"<div> our results suggest  <font color='#08A293'>that people ' s mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown<\/font> .<\/div>\",\"Confidence\":0.4370655715,\"Title\/Link\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\/\/doi.org\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Assessing the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on unhappiness, loneliness, and boredom using Google Trends<\/a>\",\"Abstract\":\"The State-imposed lockdowns in Europe and the US have led to a significant increase in Google searches on boredom, loneliness, worry and sadness. \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led many governments to implement lockdowns.

However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown.

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, a.k.a. COVID-19) has proved to be extremely contagious and the original outbreak from Asia has now spread to all continents. This situation will fruitfully profit from the study in regards of the spread of the virus, assessing effective countermeasures to weight the impact of the adopted strategies. The standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is a very successful and widely used mathematical model for predicting the spread of an epidemic. We adopt the SIR model on a random network and extend the model to include control strategies lockdown and testing -two often employed mitigation strategies. The ability of these strategies in controlling the pandemic spread is investigated by varying the effectiveness with which they are implemented. The possibility of a second outbreak is evaluated in detail after the mitigation strategies are withdrawn. We notice that, in any case, a sudden interruption of such mitigation strategies will likely induce a resurgence of a second outbreak, whose peak will be correlated to the number of susceptible individuals. In fact, we find that a population will remain vulnerable to the infection until the herd immunity is achieved. We also test our model with real statistics and information on the epidemic spread in South Korea, Germany, and New York and find a remarkable agreement with the simulation data. \\n\\n\"},{\"Lucene ID\":\"f5s37rkv\",\"BERT-SQuAD Answer with Highlights\":\"<div> the present work showed an intrinsic effect of lockdown to decrease hospital burden,  <font color='#08A293'>but its efficacy on hospital burden may have been increased if established sooner<\/font> .<\/div>\",\"Confidence\":0.2976516485,\"Title\/Link\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125765\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Quantifying hospital flows and occupancy due to COVID-19 outbreak in France.

We show that, in these models, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert a significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of a lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the end of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date without the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to explain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental models. We qualitatively discuss some important effects of a lockdown, which go beyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease an epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and the limitations of currently available data, we conclude that simple epidemiological models cannot be used to reliably quantify the impact of the Indian lockdown on fatalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n\\n\"},{\"Lucene ID\":\"ucwuptgg\",\"BERT-SQuAD Answer with Highlights\":\"<div> we find, using simulations with these estimates,  <font color='#08A293'>that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23,2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan<\/font> , even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities.<\/div>\",\"Confidence\":0.232139647,\"Title\/Link\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042424\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China<\/a>\",\"Abstract\":\"for useful comments and suggestions. All remaining errors are our own. \\n\\nWe quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We employ a set of differencein-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020.

The reason given was that the pandemic was out of control and with wide community based spread it would not be possible to contain it by tracing any longer. Like other countries the UK has since relied on a lockdown as the main measure to contain the virus (or more precisely the reproduction number R) at significant economic and social cost. It is clear that this level of lockdown cannot be sustained until a vaccine is available, yet it is not clear what an exit strategy would look like that avoids the danger of a second (or subsequent waves). \\n\\nIn this paper we argue that, when used within a portfolio of intervention strategies, widespread testing and tracing leads to significant cost savings compared to using lockdown measures alone. While the effect is most pronounced if a large proportion of the infectious population can be identified and their contacts traced, under reasonable assumptions there are still significant savings even if the fraction of infectious people found by tracing is small. \\n\\nWe also present a policy optimization model that finds, for given assumptions on the disease parameters, the best intervention strategy to contain the virus by varying the degree of tracing and lockdown measure (and vaccination once that option is available) over time. We run the model on data fitted to the published COVID-19 outbreak figures for Scotland. The model suggests an intervention strategy that keeps the number of COVID-19 deaths low using a combination of tracing and lockdown. This strategy would only require lockdown measures equivalent to a reduction of R to about 1.8-2.0 if lockdown was used alone, at acceptable economic cost, while the model finds no such strategy without tracing enabled. \\n\\n\"},{\"Lucene ID\":\"q0tjf83s\",\"BERT-SQuAD Answer with Highlights\":\"<div> this model is presented as an exit time control problem  <font color='#08A293'>where the lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity<\/font> , either naturally or via a vaccine.<\/div>\",\"Confidence\":0.2197869122,\"Title\/Link\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\/\/doi.org\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A Macroeconomic SIR Model for COVID-19<\/a>\",\"Abstract\":\"The current COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have highlighted the close and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economic health. Macroeconomic models which use preexisting epidemic models to calculate the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic which explicitly considers herd immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control problem where the lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population -those who are low-risk (ages 20-64) and those who are high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases in mortality. Additionally, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low-and high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses. Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival. \\n\\n\"},{\"Lucene ID\":\"jzokod4q\",\"BERT-SQuAD Answer with Highlights\":\"<div> contrarily, complete and partial lockdown <font color='#08A293'>s did not appear to be effective in containing the virus<\/font>  in the three largest provinces of punjab, sindh, and khyber pakhtunkhwa (kpk).<\/div>\",\"Confidence\":0.2093611658,\"Title\/Link\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\/\/doi.org\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Evaluating the Effectiveness of Regional Lockdown Policies in the Containment of Covid-19: Evidence from Pakistan<\/a>\",\"Abstract\":\"To slow down the spread of Covid-19, administrative regions within Pakistan imposed complete and partial lockdown restrictions on socio-economic activities, religious congregations, and human movement.
